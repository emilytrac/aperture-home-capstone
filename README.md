Using a __microservice architecture__, I have created a simple inventory app which allows you to :

* View all items in the inventory
* Add an item to the inventory
* Delete an item from the inventory
* Update the stock of an item
* Search for an item or items within a category
* Generate a downloadable pdf of current inventory items

This project was completed using __Eclipse IDE__, __Java 17__ and __Spring Boot 3.0.6__. Dependencies: __Lombok, MySQL Driver, Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, OpenPDF__ and __Thymeleaf__. The front end was developed with the help of __Bootstrap 5.1.3__ along with custom formatting.

The microservice nature makes this project easy to expand on. Simply copy the SQL code to create your database tables and connect using the appropriate SQL driver.
